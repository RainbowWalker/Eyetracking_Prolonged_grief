# Eyetracking_Prolonged_grief

This repository contains the preprocessing analysis (behavioural & eye-tracking) of the raw data from the experiment built in OpenSesame (OS). 

**Goal:** This experiment wishes to explore the *Griefâ€™s paradox* as discussed by Dr. Maarten C. Eisma. In essence, it's one of several studies that tests the Approach-avoidance Processing Hypothesis (APH) in Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD). Eye-tracking is employed to assess approach and avoidance in bereaved participants towards cues of the deceased person.
